- DELETE endpoint that will delete any product with its productId (any product has discount should not be deleted, an error should be returned)

Among the products in the products table in DynamoDB, only the product with the specified productId has been deleted.But when I tried to delete the discount product, the error message `discount products cannot be deleted` came up.

- UPDATE service that will change the stock of any product

We filter the product that we want to change the stock number among the products in the products table in DynamoDB with the productId and change the stock number.
